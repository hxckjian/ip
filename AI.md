# AI Usage Log

This document records my use of AI tools during the development of this project.

---

## Increment: A-Personality

**Tool Used:** ChatGPT  
**Files Involved:** `Ui.java`, `Parser.java`

---

## Purpose of AI Usage

AI was used primarily as a **language refinement and review tool** to adjust the personality and phrasing of Neko’s chat messages after updating the project theme.

The main goals were:

- Refine greeting and farewell messages.
- Improve consistency of tone across commands.
- Rewrite error messages to be playful but still clear and professional.
- Maintain concise and readable user-facing output.
- Review validation logic for potential missed edge cases.

---

## What AI Was Used For

- Generating alternative phrasings for user-facing messages.
- Ensuring consistent personality across `todo`, `deadline`, `event`, `snooze`, and error responses.
- Identifying a missing edge case in `parseEvent()` (empty date after `/from` or `/to`).
- Suggesting clearer and more user-friendly error wording.

No parsing logic, control flow, or algorithmic implementation was generated by AI.  
All validation conditions, command dispatch logic, and structural design were manually implemented.

---

## What Worked Well

- Helped quickly generate multiple tone variations.
- Improved consistency of personality across commands.
- Helped surface a subtle validation blind spot.
- Reduced time spent manually rewriting repetitive message blocks.

---

## What Required Manual Adjustment

- Some AI suggestions were overly dramatic or emoji-heavy and needed simplification.
- Validation logic still required manual reasoning and verification.
- Edge-case coverage required careful manual inspection.
- Final phrasing was manually refined to maintain clarity and professionalism.

---

## Estimated Time Saved

Approximately **30–45 minutes**, mainly in:

- Brainstorming consistent tone
- Rewriting repetitive error messages
- Reviewing possible blind spots

Core implementation and validation logic remained manually designed and tested.

---

## Reflection

AI was used as a **support tool for phrasing and review**, not as a code generator.  
It accelerated stylistic refinement and helped identify minor validation gaps.

Final responsibility for correctness, robustness, and compliance with coding standards remained manual.

---

## Increment: A-AIAssisted

**Tool Used:** ChatGPT  
**Files Involved:** `AI.md`

---

## Purpose of AI Usage

AI was used to draft the initial structure and wording of this `AI.md` file.

The goal was to:

- Ensure clarity and professionalism in documentation.
- Structure the reflection in a concise and readable format.
- Phrase the usage log objectively and accurately.
- Avoid under-reporting or over-reporting AI involvement.

---

## What AI Was Used For

- Generating the Markdown structure.
- Organizing sections (Purpose, What Worked, Reflection, etc.).
- Drafting neutral and professional phrasing.
- Refining clarity and tone.

All decisions regarding what to include, what to omit, and how to accurately represent AI involvement were made manually.

---

## Reflection

This increment is intentionally self-referential: AI was used to document the use of AI.

However, AI served only as a drafting and formatting assistant.  
The content reflects my actual usage and decisions.

Estimated time saved: **10–15 minutes** in structuring and polishing documentation.
